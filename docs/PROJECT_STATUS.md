# Project Status: Exploding Ball Engine

## Project Description

A web-based physics simulation application featuring an exploding ball engine. Users can launch a ball with custom velocity values, and the ball will explode into multiple mini balls with realistic physics, collision detection, and beautiful visual effects.

## What We've Accomplished

- Created a clean, modern web interface with gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism effects
- Implemented Matter.js physics engine for accurate physics simulation
- Built explosion system that splits main ball into configurable number of mini balls
- Added velocity input controls (X and Y components)
- Implemented collision detection between balls and walls
- Created Python web server for localhost hosting
- Added responsive design that adapts to window size
- Implemented reset functionality to clear the simulation
- Removed outlines from mini balls for cleaner visual appearance

## Current Status

✅ **Complete and Working**
- All core features implemented
- Physics engine functioning correctly
- Explosion mechanics working
- UI controls functional
- Web server ready to run

## What's Next

- Potential enhancements:
  - Add particle effects for explosions
  - Implement ball trails
  - Add sound effects
  - Create different ball types/materials
  - Add gravity adjustment controls
  - Implement ball-to-ball collision tracking

## Progress

**100% Complete** - Core functionality fully implemented and ready to use.

## Usage

Run `python3 server.py` to start the local web server. The application will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.
